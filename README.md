# Weather Dashboard
## Author: Thomas Stranick

## Description

This weather dashboard displays a city's current weather as well as a five day weather forecast. It includes a variety of different weather attributes all sourced from the OpenWeatherMap API. The searched cities are also saved on your local storage and shown on the left hand side of the screen. This project was very useful in learning and applying how to utilize an API through fetching information and displaying that information. Other skills such as local storage, bootstrap, and jquery were used to make the website functional.

## Usage

To use the webpage, the user can start by searching for the name of a city in the top left search box. Once the user searches, the city's current weather will appear at the top of the page and below the 5 day weather forecast. All of this information is fetched using the OpenWeatherMap API and stores locally. This allows for past searches to also be usable, as displayed on the left hand side. If you have already searched for a city, you can select it from the column below the search box.
